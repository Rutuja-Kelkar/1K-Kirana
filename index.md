## Why I applied to 1K kirana bazaar's design position 
**March 2022**

Righ from childhood, I enjoyed working on challenging & high quality problems. It was my stuff :)
Here's my [interesting digi info story](https://www.rutujakelkar.com/) : a skill development platform I built in my last year of engineering (late 2020), resulted in formation of 3000+ student community members. 

At 1K, they are building Bharatâ€™s first network of Offline and Online (O&O) hyperlocal stores. 1K is an asset light model where stores are owned & operated by franchise partners (erstwhile kiranas) while 1K handles the entire sourcing, inventory management, pricing and sales & marketing for each store. The idea is to cater to every need of consumers in these markets leading to higher throughput for our franchise partners ultimately leading to a higher income for the franchisees and better experience for consumers.

I also loved the fact that they are solving for consumers desires first, which will automatically lead to increase in sales & income for their business partners. I totally believe sales & mmarketing with quality services are key factors to success of a start up. [Here's how I learnt sales : project redo](https://rutuja-kelkar.github.io/redo/).

I found this problem quite interesting and challenging and hence I applied to 1K kirana's product design role. Right after application I got a response from HR You've been shortlisted and here's your task to solve to qualify for next round 

[Here's how ](https://rutuja-kelkar.github.io/redo/) the design task looks like, I'll be solving this problem statement in rest of this article.

#### **Major insights gathered from above data:**

Since I'm from a tier 2 city : Belgaum, karnataka. I deeply understand the mindset of people living there. People living in tier 2 / tier 3 cities are mostly slow paced, they do not run against time to get things done, living education transport food etc is affordable. These cities have **high trust, low ego repos** within society. Cash was pre-dominent means of currency exchange until the advent of e-wallets.

With the advent of e-wallet apps like paytm, phone, UPI monetary transactions are as easy as breathing. Tier 2 / 3 cities have adopted monetary transaction behaviour well. 

Digital wallets are highly used to make everyday transactions along with an added perk of transferring funds from one wallet holder to another wallet holder. One of the most well-known payment platforms is Paytm, known for transforming the habits of spending money.
