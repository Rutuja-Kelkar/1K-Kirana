## Why I applied to 1K kirana's design position 
**March 2022**

Righ from childhood, I enjoyed working on challenging & high quality problems. It was my stuff :)
Here's my [interesting digi info story](https://www.rutujakelkar.com/) : a skill development platform I built in my last year of engineering (late 2020), resulted in formation of 3000+ student community members. 

At 1K, they are building Bharatâ€™s first network of Offline and Online (O&O) hyperlocal stores. 1K is an asset light model where stores are owned & operated by franchise partners (erstwhile kiranas) while 1K handles the entire sourcing, inventory management, pricing and sales & marketing for each store. The idea is to cater to every need of consumers in these markets leading to higher throughput for our franchise partners ultimately leading to a higher income for the franchisees and better experience for consumers.

I also loved the fact that they are solving for consumers desires first, which will automatically lead to increase in sales & income for their business partners. I totally believe sales & mmarketing with quality services are key factors to success of a start up. [Here's how I learnt sales : project redo](https://rutuja-kelkar.github.io/redo/).

I found this problem quite interesting and challenging and hence I applied to 1K kirana's product design role. Right after application I got a response from HR You've been shortlisted and here's your task to solve to qualify for next round 

[Here's how ](https://rutuja-kelkar.github.io/redo/) the design task looks like, I'll be solving this problem statement in rest of this article.
